# Nexus Umbrella Docs

This folder captures the cross-repo story for the Nexus platform: what it is,
how the pieces fit, and the end-to-end user and operator flows. Treat these
docs as the umbrella-level narrative that ties the repos together.

## Entry Points

- `../ARCHITECTURE.md` — System boundaries and repo map.
- `STORY.md` — Cohesive narrative for the platform.
- `FLOWS.md` — Core user flows + internal launch flows.
- `DECISIONS.md` — Canonical decisions and open questions.
- `ROADMAP.md` — Dogfood → launch plan aligned to priorities.
- `IDEAS.md` — Idea backlog + tasks to triage later.
- `SKILL_SPEC.md` — Local skill spec and CLI/hub alignment.

## Source Material (Repo-Level)

- `nexus-cli/docs/feature-inventory/overview.md`
- `nexus-cli/docs/*` (CLI behavior, onboarding, agent bindings)
- `nexus-cloud/*` (sync engine + daemon)
- `nexus-website/specs/*` (Hub + taxonomy)
- `nexus-collab/*` (realtime collaboration)
