# Upstream Reference Documentation

**Purpose:** Consolidated reference documentation from openclaw (upstream) for comparison and sync purposes.

---

## Structure

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `acl/` | Openclaw's approach to access control |
| `adapters/` | Channel inventory, inbound/outbound patterns |
| `agent-system/` | Upstream agent architecture |
| `workspace/` | Gateway channels, workspace structure |

---

## Usage

These documents capture how openclaw does things. Use them:
1. When syncing upstream changes
2. To understand what Nexus diverges from
3. As reference for feature parity decisions

**Note:** This is reference material, not active specs. The active Nexus specs are in the sibling folders (`nex/`, `acl/`, `adapters/`, etc.).
