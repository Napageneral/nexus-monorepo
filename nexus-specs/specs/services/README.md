# Cloud Services

Optional platform features.

---

## What This Is

Cloud services are **additional platform capabilities** that extend Nexus beyond local operation.

---

## Components

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `cloud/` | Sync and backup — encrypted cloud storage of home directory |
| `collab/` | Collaboration spaces — multi-user/multi-agent shared environments |

---

## Cloud Sync

Encrypted backup and sync of the user's `home/` directory:

- Keys stay local — server never sees plaintext
- Selective sync via `.nexusignore`
- Cross-device restoration

## Collaboration

Shared spaces for multi-user and multi-agent scenarios:

- Shared workspaces
- Agent-to-agent communication across instances
- Collaborative sessions
