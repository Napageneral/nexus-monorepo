# Adapters Spec

**Status:** DESIGN IN PROGRESS  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-06

---

## Overview

Adapters connect Nexus to external platforms. They handle:
- **Inbound:** Receiving messages, normalizing to `NexusEvent`
- **Outbound:** Formatting and delivering responses

Adapters are external tools (like `eve`, `gog`, `discord-cli`) that meet defined interfaces.

### Upstream Reference

| Spec | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `upstream/CHANNEL_INVENTORY.md` | All channels in OpenClaw |
| `upstream/TOOL_HOOK_MECHANISM.md` | How tool hooks work (and don't) |
| `upstream/OPENCLAW_INBOUND.md` | OpenClaw inbound patterns |
| `upstream/OPENCLAW_OUTBOUND.md` | OpenClaw outbound patterns |

## Quick Start

**Read `ADAPTER_SYSTEM.md`** for the full operational system (registration, lifecycle, accounts).  
**Read `ADAPTER_INTERFACES.md`** for data contracts (NexusEvent, DeliveryResult, ChannelCapabilities).

## Key Concepts

### 1. External Tools

Adapters are external binaries that meet the interface:

```bash
# Inbound: tool emits events
eve monitor --format jsonl

# Outbound: tool sends messages
eve send --chat-id "+1234567890" --text "Hello"
```

### 2. Separate Interfaces

Inbound and outbound are separate. One tool can implement both, or use different tools:

| Tool | Inbound | Outbound | Channel |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| `eve` | ✅ | ✅ | iMessage |
| `gog` | ✅ | ✅ | Gmail |
| `aix` | ✅ | ❌ | AI sessions |

### 3. Capabilities

Each channel exposes capabilities for agent context:

```typescript
capabilities: {
  text_limit: 2000,          // Discord
  supports_markdown: true,
  supports_embeds: true,
  // ...
}
```

### 4. NexusRequest Integration

Adapters create/consume `NexusRequest`:
- Inbound adapter creates request with delivery context
- Outbound adapter uses request to route response

## Channel Support

### Per-Channel Specs

See `channels/` folder. All channels from upstream are documented:

| Channel | Upstream | Spec | Nexus Tool |
|---------|----------|------|------------|
| Discord | Full | `channels/discord.md` | TBD |
| Telegram | Full | `channels/telegram.md` | TBD |
| WhatsApp | Full | `channels/whatsapp.md` | Baileys |
| iMessage | Full | `channels/imessage.md` | `eve` |
| Signal | Full | `channels/signal.md` | signal-cli |
| Slack | Full | `channels/slack.md` | TBD |
| LINE | Full | `channels/line.md` | TBD |
| Gmail | Hooks only | `channels/gmail.md` | `gog` |
| Google Chat | Config only | `channels/googlechat.md` | — |
| MS Teams | Config only | `channels/msteams.md` | — |

Each spec includes:
- Capabilities object
- Formatting rules and limits
- Media handling
- Porting notes

## Open Questions

1. **Formatting guidance injection** — Just-in-time guidance when message tool is called. Strategy defined in `ADAPTER_SYSTEM.md` (tool response hints). See `upstream/TOOL_HOOK_MECHANISM.md` for deeper investigation.

2. **Webhook adapters** — Adapters that need to receive webhooks (Telegram, LINE) run their own HTTP server. NEX connects to them for health but doesn't manage the listener port.

3. **Media handling** — Per-channel media limits and formats. See `channels/` for current specs.

4. **Rate limiting** — Should NEX enforce outbound rate limits globally, or leave to adapters? Currently adapter-managed.
